    Acquire a lock on a resource.

    This function uses a file-based lock, so it will work within a container, but not across containers.
    For cross-container lock, we would need a database-based lock (Redis supports distributed locks with TTLs,
    PostgresSQL supports distributed locks without TTL).

    The function attempts to acquire the lock every `delay` seconds. If it fails to acquire the lock after `timeout`
    seconds, an error is raised.

    If `ttl` is specified, ensures the lock is kept for AT MOST `ttl` seconds, referred to as the lock TTL.
    If the lock TTL has expired, the lock file is deleted and the lock is released.

    We use a secondary lock to ensure only 1 process at a time can operate on the lock file.
