"""
Mapping compute plans to workers makes sure that the tasks that have to be executed by
/ on a compute pod are always sent to the worker on which the compute pod is.
This is necessary for compute tasks and for compute pod removal.

The ComputePlanWorkerMapping psql table records which compute plan is mapped to which
worker.
For traceability reasons, the "release_date" column keeps history on
computeplan/worker mapping.
- "release_date" with DateTime value: there was a compute pod for this compute plan on
this worker, but there is not anymore. The date gives the datetime when the worker was
released.
- empty "release_date" means: there is __currently__ a compute pod for this compute plan
on this worker.

At a given point in time, a compute plan can only be mapped to one worker. This is
enforced by a unique condition in the ComputePlanWorkerMapping model.
