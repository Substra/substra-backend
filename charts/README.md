# Backend charts

## Update the chart Readme
If you update the values in the chart `values.yaml` file you will want to update the documentation related to these values in the `README.md` file.
This documentation is auto-generated using [readme-generator-for-helm](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/readme-generator-for-helm).
It ensures that the documentation in the `values.yaml` files stays in sync with the values in the `README.md`.

If you want to know more about the documentation string format, refer to the [`readme-generator` Readme](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/readme-generator-for-helm/tree/3300343a6cd1c9cd86d13b04d8c85a7415cb849e#metadata).

If you want to update the `README.md` file you need to run `make doc` from this directory.
