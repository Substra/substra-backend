# Metrics exporter

The goal of this component is to expose metrics produced by a Django app.
Using the `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` env variable you can make an app that run in multiple proceses write metrics in a folder. This app gather these metrics from the folder and expose them.

This is particularly useful if you want to expose your metrics on a different port than the Django app.

This is based on the [prometheus-client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) Python library.

## Installation

There is no specific installation steps, you just have to install the dependecies:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launching the server

You can start the server exposing metrics by using this command:
```
$ PYTHONPATH=. python metrics_exporter/server.py
```

## Settings
These settings can be set through env variables.
